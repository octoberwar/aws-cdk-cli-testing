# AWS CDK CLI Testing

This repository contains the integration tests of the AWS CDK CLI repository.

They are extracted to a separate repository because there is a dependency between our 3 different repos:

```mermaid
graph TD
  aws-cdk-lib --> |devDependency| cdk-cli
  cdk-cli-testing --> aws-cdk-lib
  cdk-cli-testing --> cdk-cli
```

## Usage

```sh
$ bin/run-suite \
  --use-cli-release=2.175.0 \
  --verbose \
  cli-integ-tests",
```
